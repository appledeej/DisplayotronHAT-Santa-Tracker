# DisplayotronHAT-Santa-Tracker
A santa tracker that shows where Santa is on the Pimoroni DisplayotronHAT, feel free to convert for Displayotron 3000

This is essentially just a timer that changes the current country/continent every 10, 30 or 45 minutes

The Display will say N/A at first but change in 5 minutes to add realism.

Start the tracker about 2.58 hours before the childs bed time and it'll even tell you when to get into bed!

Feel Free to edit anything! As long as you give me credit for the original and don't remove any of my name.
